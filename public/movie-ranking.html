    <h1>Best Movies According to Sinichay</h1>
    <h2>My Top 3 Favourite Movies of all time</h2>
    <hr />
    <h3>Rush Hour (1, 2 & 3)</h3>
    <p>Best and funniest duo between Chris Tucker (Carter) and Jackie Chan (Lee). Both make me laugh so much. 
    Alongside action was entertaining.</p>
    <h3>Avengers Infinity War</h3>
    <p>Very exciting from beginning, middle and end. Also surprising with the outcome of the movie, 
    which I did not expected at all.</p>
    <h3>Den of Thieves</h3>
    <p>I am a fan of shootout heist movies. This movie brought in my opinion a lot of impactful moments that I was so happy to see. 
    Plus, there is Den of Thieves 2 coming out very soon.</p>
    <h2>Other movies shoutouts</h2>
    <P>This section is my other personal movies I enjoyed but did not made the top 3, but still my favourite movies that I enjoyed.</P>
    <p>1. Deadpool 1 & 2</p>
    <p>2. Deadpool & Wolverine</p>
    <p>3. Star Wars episodes 1 to 6 (Episode 7 and 9 was not bad, decent movie those two. However, 8 was awful in my opinion.)</p>
